## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution # Constitution - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App

## Project Phase
This is Phase I of Hackathon II - The Evolution of Todo.  
We are building a simple command-line Todo application that stores tasks in memory only.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Spec-Driven Development Only**  
   - No manual coding allowed  
   - All code must be generated by Claude Code / Qwen based on refined specifications  
   - We refine the spec until the AI generates correct, clean code

2. **In-Memory Storage Only**  
   - No files, no database, no persistence  
   - All tasks stored in a Python list during runtime  
   - Data lost when program exits (as required for Phase I)

3. **Clean, Professional Python Code**  
   - Python 3.13+ syntax  
   - Full type hints mandatory  
   - Proper docstrings for functions and modules  
   - Meaningful variable and function names  
   - Consistent formatting (PEP 8 compliant)

4. **Task Data Structure**  
   Every task must be a dictionary with exactly these fields:
   - id: int (auto-increment, unique)
   - title: str (required, 1-200 characters)
   - description: str (optional)
   - completed: bool (default: False)

5. **User Interface**  
   - Simple text-based menu in a loop  
   - Clear prompts and feedback messages  
   - Graceful error handling (invalid input, task not found etc.)  
   - No external libraries – only Python standard library

6. **Basic Features (Must Implement All)**  
   - Add Task  
   - View All Tasks (with status indicators [ ] and [✓])  
   - Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete  
   - Update Task (title and/or description)  
   - Delete Task  
   - Exit option

7. **Project Structure**  
   - All source code in /src folder  
   - Main executable: src/todo_app.py  
   - Specifications in /specs folder  
   - CLAUDE.md or QWEN.md at root with instructions

## Goal
Build a fully working console app using only spec-driven approach.  
The judges will evaluate:
- Quality of specifications  
- Number of iterations to get correct code  
- Cleanliness and correctness of generated code  
- Adherence to these constitutional principles

We follow the Agentic Dev Stack:  
Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Refine Spec → Repeat
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the specific principles for the Phase I Todo App project. The new constitution includes all seven core principles, additional constraints, development workflow, and governance sections as specified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution file with all specified principles
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan the implementation of the todo app based on the constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution provides clear guidelines for the development of the todo app, ensuring adherence to spec-driven development and clean code practices.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin specification of the todo app features

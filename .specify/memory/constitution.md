# Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development Only
- No manual coding allowed; All code must be generated by Claude Code / Qwen based on refined specifications; We refine the spec until the AI generates correct, clean code

### II. In-Memory Storage Only
- No files, no database, no persistence; All tasks stored in a Python list during runtime; Data lost when program exits (as required for Phase I)

### III. Clean, Professional Python Code
- Python 3.13+ syntax; Full type hints mandatory; Proper docstrings for functions and modules; Meaningful variable and function names; Consistent formatting (PEP 8 compliant)

### IV. Task Data Structure
Every task must be a dictionary with exactly these fields:
- id: int (auto-increment, unique)
- title: str (required, 1-200 characters)
- description: str (optional)
- completed: bool (default: False)

### V. User Interface
- Simple text-based menu in a loop; Clear prompts and feedback messages; Graceful error handling (invalid input, task not found etc.); No external libraries – only Python standard library

### VI. Basic Features (Must Implement All)
- Add Task
- View All Tasks (with status indicators [ ] and [✓])
- Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete
- Update Task (title and/or description)
- Delete Task
- Exit option

### VII. Project Structure
- All source code in /src folder
- Main executable: src/todo_app.py
- Specifications in /specs folder
- CLAUDE.md or QWEN.md at root with instructions

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack requirements:
- Python 3.13+ only
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Type hints required for all functions
- Proper error handling for all user inputs
- Clean, readable code following PEP 8

## Development Workflow
- Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Refine Spec → Repeat
- All code must be generated from specifications
- No manual coding allowed
- All changes must follow the agentic dev stack workflow
- Code review must verify compliance with constitutional principles

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices for this project. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles. The judges will evaluate quality of specifications, number of iterations to get correct code, cleanliness and correctness of generated code, and adherence to these constitutional principles.
